// Steps to follow - 

- Create a .js file called arrayTasks and open the arrayTask.html file, feel free to make any changes.

- In arrayTask.js, write the code needed to do the following (use functions):
    ○ Create an array called ‘favLanguages’ that includes at least 5
    programming languages. 
    Use a loop to display each programming language in ‘favLanguages’ on
    arrayTask.html in the list element: <ul id="favLanguages">.

- Create an array called ‘myTestResults’ that stores a list of results out
  of 100 that you have scored for 5 tests that you have written
  in a class.
       E.g. let myTestResults = [40, 60, 80, 80, 85];   

- Write the code that will calculate the average grade based on the
  results in my ‘myJSTestResults’. For example, the average grade
  based on the values in the example above would be:
            let average = (40 + 60 + 80 + 80 + 85)/5;

            Average percentage Letter symbol
                    80 - 100 = A
                    70 - 79 = B
                    60 - 69 = C
                    50 - 59 = D
                    49 or less = F

- Output the grade on arrayTask.html by creating a div element with the id 'myGrade'.
